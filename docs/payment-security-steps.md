## Notes
- Each item should be tested thoroughly before being marked as complete
- Regular security audits should be performed
- Keep documentation updated as features are implemented
- Monitor for new security threats and update accordingly

## Progress Tracking
- Total Tasks: 49
- Completed: 0
- Remaining: 49
- Last Updated: [Date]

## Priority Levels
ðŸ”´ Critical - Must be implemented immediately
ðŸŸ¡ High - Should be implemented in current sprint
ðŸŸ¢ Medium - Plan for next sprint
âšª Low - Nice to have, schedule when possible

## Next Steps
1. Start with Critical priority items
2. Implement basic security measures first
3. Add more complex security features
4. Regular testing and validation
5. Documentation and team training
